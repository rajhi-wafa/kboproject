                        <h2>Inflammation 101</h2>
                        <p>The Eat Burn Sleep Lifestyle is vital to reducing inflammation, which is a natural
                            response the body triggers to defend us or repair. It’s a healthy immune response. For
                            instance, when you cut yourself and the skin reddens around the cut, this inflammatory
                            response helps your body to heal.</p>
                        <p>However, sustained and ongoing inflammation, also called chronic inflammation, is
                            extremely damaging for our bodies and minds. The majority of health issues or symptoms
                            you might be experiencing, when not linked to a virus, will generally have their root in
                            chronic inflammation. Anxiety, bloating, hormonal issues, infertility, autoimmune
                            disorders, depression, eczema, rosacea, PCOS, Crohn’s disease, colitis, psoriasis,
                            arthritis, joint pain, brain fog, low energy levels, stiffness, low mood, acne, skin
                            issues, premature aging, etc. are all linked to chronic inflammation.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">When it comes to viruses, it is essential to keep a low inflammation
                            lifestyle in order to have a strong immune response. As a final note, chronic
                            inflammation is a major factor in predicting COVID-19 related complications.</p>

                            <p>Yalda Alaoui is a London-based entrepreneur, gut health and inflammation expert,
                                former capital market professional, and a mother of two boys aged 10 and 12. She is
                                half-Moroccan, half-Persian (Iranian), and she grew up in Morocco until the age of
                                12 when she moved to France. Yalda received a Master’s degree from EDHEC Business
                                School in France before moving to London to do a postgraduate in accounting and
                                finance at the London School of Economics.</p>

                            <h3>Yalda’s Health Journey and the Creation of Eat Burn Sleep</h3>
                            <p>Yalda has always been interested in health. However, it is her own health journey and
                                the fact that she was diagnosed with two auto-immune diseases – Ulcerative Colitis
                                in 2017 and Auto-Immune Haemolytic Anaemia- in 2012 – that made her begin to
                                extensively research nutrition and health. </p>
                            <p>Over nearly a decade she saw numerous specialists for her two autoimmune conditions,
                                as well as nutritionists, naturopaths, and holistic doctors in the US, Europe, and
                                Asia. Yalda spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to find a solution to
                                begin to feel healthy again. </p>
                            <p>During her research, Yalda began to understand that the key factor in many
                                non-communicable diseases is chronic inflammation and, as a consequence, also gut
                                health. This motivated her to develop a diet and lifestyle to combat this. After
                                many years of trial and error, she has finally managed to keep herself in remission
                                and live a normal life again. Not only that, but Yalda is also healthier than she
                                has ever been. Many medical professionals now consider Yalda to be an authority in
                                this area and often contact her to help solve new and increasing numbers of medical
                                issues arising which are challenging the medical establishment. </p>

                            <p>As a result of this success and her passion for health, Yalda decided to share her
                                knowledge and help more people. In 2018 Eat Burn Sleep was born and by now,
                                thousands of people around the globe have embraced the Eat Burn Sleep
                                anti-inflammatory lifestyle and have managed to significantly improve their health.
                            </p>

                            <p>Eat Burn Sleep has become a successful business that keeps growing and evolving as
                                Yalda continues to expand her research on gut health and inflammation and
                                additionally, Yalda is completing her third and final year of nutrition studies at
                                the College of Naturopathic Medicine in London to become a naturopathic
                                nutritionist. </p>
